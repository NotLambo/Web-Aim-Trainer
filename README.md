# Web-Aim-Trainer
This is a Web Aim Trainer that allows a user too click up too 15 different targets across the screen.

This aim trainer is right for you, from the retro style all the way too the sleek and calm range. This trainer offers light and dark mode support as well with a way too exit the game (ESC) if you ever want too quit.

-- This is a project that is on the bigger side of things when it comes too all my past projects so it is very much apperciated  that you follow and star. Thanks <3
